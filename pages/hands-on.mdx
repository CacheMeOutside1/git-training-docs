# Hands On With Git

##There are several ways to start working with Git:

### Create a new repo locally

1. Create the directory for the repo you want to make.
1. `cd` into it.
1. run `git init`.
1. This will make the directory into a brand new empty local repo. This does not do anything with github its purely local.

### Clone an existing repository from Github

1. For example: Go [here](https://github.com/jaescalo/git-training-docs)
1. The follow the steps in this screen shot:
   ![Cloning a Repository](/repo-clone.png)
1. Once you have the URL in your clipboard,in your termimal navigate to where you want your repos to live
1. run `git clone git@github.com:jaescalo/git-training-docs.git`
1. this will clone the repo from github to your local!
1. if you type `ls` you should now see a directory for the cloned repo.
1. you can `cd` into it
1. if you type `ls` you should see the same files displayed in github.
1. if you type `git status` it should tell you that you are on the main branch.
1. it will set up a default remote called origin. Origin is simply the default name given. It can be a bit deceptive depending on if you clone first from a main repo or a fork. As matter of principle I try to not clone from a fork for that reason.
1. Now you have a copy that you can work with!

### Create a new empty repo from github

1. Go to github.com
1. Follow the steps in the screenshot. OR simply go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   ![Creating a new Repository](/new-repo.png)
1. The follow the steps in
   ![Creating a new Repository Part 2](/new-repo-2.png)
1. if the repo was initialized with files you can clone it.
1. If the repo is empty you can add it as a remote and push to it.
1. `git remote add <repo name> repo_ssh_url`
1. `git push origin`

## Working with a repo

### Clone

1. For the sake of this class: clone `https://github.com/jaescalo/git-training-docs`. See instructions above :).
1. cd into the repo.
1. run `git remote update` to get all the changes from your remote repo.  
   In this case there are none but i recommend running this command whenever you create a new branch,
   and periodically running it to get the latest changes so you can drop your commits on top of the latest shared code.
1. Run `git log` to now see the change reflected in your commit history
1. run `git remote -v` to show all the remote repositories that you might push your changes to.

### Branch

1. create a new branch to work from: `git checkout -b my-git-experiments origin/main`. There is a LOT here. `-b my-git-experiments origin/main` says give me a new branch based off main in my remote origin.

### Edit

1. open `pages.index.mdx`
1. make an edit to the file
1. run `git status` to see the file change and the location of the file.

### Stage and Commit

1. stage the change for a commit by doing `git add <filename-including-path>`. Note you can stage multiple files at once for use in a single commit.
1. commit the change and record it with a clear commit message. In this command the -m argument allows you to specify a message.
   `git commit -m "Made a simple change to index.mdx so that we can show how commits work."`
1. Run `git log` to now see the change reflected in your commit history

### Push

1. Try to push the changes to origin. It will fail.

```
 git push origin
ERROR: Permission to jaescalo/git-training-docs.git denied to aweingarten.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

1. It's common for people not to grant push access to public repos. In private repos you may have the ability to push.

### What the heck is a github fork?

A GitHub fork is a personal copy of someone else's repository that resides in your GitHub account. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. It is a common practice in open-source development, where developers fork a repository to contribute to a project by making changes and then submitting those changes back to the original repository via a pull request.

### How to Fork a Repository on GitHub

1. Navigate to the Repository: Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork.
1. Click the Fork Button: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page.
1. Select Your Account: Choose your GitHub account or organization where you want to create the fork.
   Clone the Forked Repository: Once the fork is created, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/forked-repo.git`. However, in this case we already have cloned from `jaescalo/git-training-docs`.
   If we cloned again we'd simply have 2 disjointed folders/repos.

### How to Work with the Fork

1. Instead we can add this as a new remote in our local repo. e.g `git remote add <fork-name> <your fork address>`. When I am adding a new fork I like to use my github username as the remote name. So in my case I would run `git remote add aweingarten git@github.com:aweingarten/git-training-docs.git`
1. To verify that its working run `git remote update` that will fetch all the updates from the remote repo.
1. Run `git remote -v` you should see a fetch and remote record for both origin and your username!
1. Now you can do `git push <your remote name>`
1. If you have set everything up right you should see some output like below:

```
git push aweingarten
Enumerating objects: 23, done.
Counting objects: 100% (23/23), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (18/18), done.

Total 18 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), completed with 2 local objects.
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'git-curriculum-v1' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/aweingarten/git-training-docs/pull/new/git-curriculum-v1
remote:
To github.com:aweingarten/git-training-docs.git
* [new branch]      git-curriculum-v1 -> git-curriculum-v1
```

its telling us that we have pushed our local branch to the remote repository/fork. They have even been kind enough to give us a URL so we can submit a request to merge the code into the main repo.

### Creating your first Pull Request.

1.  Visit the url in your browser and follow the steps in the screen shot to make your first pull request:
    ![Setting up a pull Request](/pull-request_screen.jpg)

For any questions about submitting a pull-request see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
For more detailed information about forks go[here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks)

## Conclusion

Congrats you have successfully:

1. Configured Git

1. Forked the repo
1. Added a remote
1. Created a local branch
1. Made an edit to a file
1. Make a commit to your local branch
1. Pushed that change to github
1. Submitted a pull request.

In the next class we will talk about code reviews, and dealing with fixing mistakes and even rewriting history. If you like `Back to the Future` you will love the next class!
